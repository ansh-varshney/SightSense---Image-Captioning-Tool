# SightSense - I Tell What I See üëÅÔ∏è

## Introduction
SightSense is an advanced **Image Captioning System** that combines **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks to automatically generate descriptive captions for images. With SightSense, the system "sees" and "understands" the content of an image and provides a human-readable description, making it useful for a wide range of applications such as accessibility, social media, and more.

## Features ‚ú®
- **Image Captioning**: Generates descriptive captions for images, providing meaningful text output based on the content.
- **Real-Time Image Understanding**: The system processes images in real-time and returns descriptive captions, understanding complex visual contexts.
- **Pre-trained Model Integration**: Leverages pre-trained CNN models (e.g., ResNet50) for efficient feature extraction from images.
- **Seamless Integration**: The model combines CNN for image processing and LSTM for natural language generation to provide accurate, context-aware captions.
- **Customizable**: The architecture allows for customization with different CNN and LSTM configurations for improved performance on domain-specific data.
- **Web Interface**: A user-friendly website has been created where users can upload images and receive captions instantly.

## How It Works üîç

### 1. **Image Processing (CNN Encoder)**
   - **Feature Extraction**: The first step involves passing an image through a pre-trained **ResNet50** model, which extracts the high-level features of the image.
   - **Convolutional Layers**: ResNet50 uses convolutional layers to analyze the image at various scales and recognize objects, textures, and patterns. These extracted features are stored as vectors representing the image in a compressed form.
   - **Transfer Learning**: The pre-trained model has been trained on large datasets like **ImageNet**, which enables it to recognize a wide range of objects and visual patterns effectively.

### 2. **Caption Generation (LSTM Decoder)**
   - **Sequence Prediction**: Once the image features are extracted by the CNN, they are passed to an **LSTM** network. The LSTM learns to generate a sequence of words (a caption) based on the features provided by the CNN.
   - **Word-by-Word Prediction**: The LSTM decodes the image features step-by-step, generating a caption word by word. It captures the relationships between the extracted features and the context of the image.
   - **Language Understanding**: The LSTM is trained on datasets with image-caption pairs, enabling it to understand linguistic structures and form coherent sentences.

### 3. **Database Creation and Usage**
   - The system uses the **Flickr8k dataset** (available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k)) for training and generating captions. This dataset consists of 8,000 images with corresponding captions, which are used to train the model for both visual recognition and text generation.
   - The **image-caption pairs** from the dataset are processed to create a database that links image features to their corresponding captions. This database is then used for training and fine-tuning the CNN and LSTM components to improve caption generation accuracy.
   - (Note: The **Flickr8k dataset** is not included in the GitHub repository due to size limitations.)

### 4. **Generating Captions for New Images**
   - **Real-Time Processing**: Once the model is trained, it can process new images. The CNN extracts features from the input image, and these features are passed to the LSTM, which generates a caption.
   - **Output**: The generated caption describes the content of the image, including objects, actions, and relationships, providing a natural language output that can be used for accessibility, media tagging, and more.

## Website for Caption Generation üåê
- A **web interface** has been developed to allow users to upload images and receive the generated captions directly. The website provides an easy-to-use experience for generating captions in real-time.
- Users can interact with the system by simply uploading an image, and the backend processes the image, generates a caption, and displays it on the screen.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: For feature extraction from images.
- **Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM)**: For sequence generation (captioning) based on the features.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For implementing and training the CNN and LSTM models.
- **Pre-trained Models**: ResNet50 (for image feature extraction), fine-tuned for the captioning task.
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for implementing the system.
- **NumPy**: For handling numerical operations and data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizations and analysis of model performance.
- **HTML/CSS/JS**: For building the user-friendly web interface.
- **DBMS**: For storing and managing image-caption pairs in a database for training and real-time caption generation.
- **Flickr8k Dataset**: The dataset used for training (not included in the repo; available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k)).

## Conclusion üéØ
SightSense leverages the power of **CNN** and **LSTM** to create a system capable of understanding images and generating descriptive captions that accurately reflect the content. By combining cutting-edge computer vision and natural language processing techniques, the system not only "sees" the image but also "speaks" about it in human-readable language, making it a valuable tool in various fields like accessibility, social media, and content management.

With SightSense, your images can now tell a story! üì∏‚ú®
